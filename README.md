Power BI dashboard analyzing global terrorism


An interesting data set is the "Global Terrorism Database (GTD)" which is an open database including information from 1970 - 2015 (as of June 2017) on terrorist attacks around the globe.Â 


I decided to use a portion of the dataset to create a terrorism dashboard showing:

1. High level trends
2. Casuality Analysis
3. Where terrorist attacks have happened
